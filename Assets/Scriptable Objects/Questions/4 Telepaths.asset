  bodyText: 'There is a lot of heated discussion at the local tavern over a grouped
    of people called ''Telepaths''. They have been hired by certain City-State kings.
    Rumor has it these Telepaths read a person''s mind and tell their lord whether
    a follower is telling the truth or not.


    What do you do?'
  option1Text: This is a terrible practice. A person's thoughts are his own and no
    one, not even a king, has the right to make such an invasion into another human's
    mind.
  consequence1: 1
  option2Text: Loyal followers to the king have nothing to fear from a Telepath. It
    is important to have a method of finding assassins and spies before it is too
    late.
  consequence2: 2
  option3Text: In these times, it is a necessary evil. Although you do not necessarily
    like the idea, a Telepath could have certain advantages during a time of war or
    in finding someone innocent of a crime.
  consequence3: 3
