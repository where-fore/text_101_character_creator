  text: "While out hunting, you have successfully tracked a young deer. As you silently
    approach, arrow drawn, you notice a figure in the woodline, opposite the deer.
    There is another person, arrow also drawn in your direction. What do you do?\r"
  options:
  - 1. Fire at the stranger. The woods are dangerous, and you will not be ambushed.
  - 2. Fire at your prey, securing it. If they wanted the deer, they needed to be
    faster.
  - 3. Wait out the tense moment. Your shot at this animal isn't worth entering whatever
    this situation may evolve into.
