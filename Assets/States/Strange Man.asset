  text: As you are walking the streets, a strange man who is dressed in outlandish
    colours run up to you, begging your help. A small mob is not too far behind him.
    What do you do?
  options:
  - 1. Offer your help, someone has to stand up for the persecuted.
  - 2. Do not get involved. You know better than to put yourself in a situation you
    do not understand.
  - 3. Stop him and ask him, and the coming mob, for more information. Something is
    obviously wrong, and it is to be solved.
