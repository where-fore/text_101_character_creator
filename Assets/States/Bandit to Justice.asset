  text: There is a stir in the town as an infamous bandit has been caught and sentenced
    to death. There have been many robberies and murders of nobles to their name.
    Your friend asks for your opinion on the matter. What do you do?
  options:
  - 1. Explain that you support their execution. A crime deserves equal punishment.
  - 2. Explain that you are indifferent. If you step on the wrong people's toes, you
    will always pay the price eventually. This is how the fair world works.
  - 3. Explain that justice is required, but death is never an answer. If the objective
    is to stop killings, we should always start by staying our own hands.
