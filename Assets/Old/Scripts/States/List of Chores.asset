  text: Your father has presented you with a list of chores to pick from, as he sets
    off to his forge to work for the day. What do you do?
  options:
  - 1. Join your father at the forge, casting iron for a new plow.
  - 2. Gather your woodworking tools and try to work on your shed, which gave in to
    the recent rainfall.
  - 3. Return to the hides you tanned and begin leatherworking your own set of gloves.
  - 4. Dig up the schematics for the new irrigation system your father found, and
    try to figure out how to build the strange machine.
