  text: You are at the baker's stand, preparing to buy a fresh loaf for your family.
    The little boy in front of you seems overjoyed at their recent sweetroll purchase.
    You watch them skip off to enjoy their treat, as a group of 3 similarly-aged boys
    follow him. You see the group accosting the young boy for his sweetroll. What
    do you do?
  options:
  - 1. Intervene. Tell the bullies to back off - someone has to keep the peace, and
    it might as well be you.
  - 2. Ignore them, let the world will take it's course. The boy won't always have
    someone watching out for him, and he should learn that with now over just a sweetroll.
  - 3. While the shopkeep isn't looking, try to grab an extra sweetroll for the poor
    boy. He paid for one, and he deserves one.
