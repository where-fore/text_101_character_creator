  text: You are out alone in the woods and come upon a strange animal you have never
    seen before, caught in the jaws of a hunter's trap. The animal is twitching and
    looks in pain. What do you do?
  options:
  - 1. Draw your knife and with one swift cut, put it out of it's misery.
  - 2. Take this chance to study the animal, learning more about a creature you have
    never encountered. There is always more to learn, and you don't know if you'll
    get another chance to examine this beast.
  - 3. Grab some herbs from your sack to try and soothe the animal to sleep, not interfering
    with the hunter or the hunted.
