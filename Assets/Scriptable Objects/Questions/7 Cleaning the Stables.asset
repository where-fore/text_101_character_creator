  m_Name: 7 Cleaning the Stables
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  bodyText: 'Your father sends you on a task which you loathe, cleaning the stables.
    On the way there, pitchfork in hand, you run into your friend from the homestead
    near your own. He offers to do it for you, in return for a future favor of his
    choosing.


    What do you do?'
  option1Text: Decline his offer, knowing that your father expects you to do the work,
    and it is better not to be in debt.
  consequence1: 1
  option2Text: Ask him to help you, knowing that two people can do the job faster
    than one, and agree to help him with one task of his choosing in the future.
  consequence2: 2
  option3Text: Accept his offer, reasoning that as long as the stables are cleaned,
    it matters not who does the cleaning.
  consequence3: 3
