  stateID: Clean the Stables
  text: Your father presents with a chore with you loathe, cleaning the stables. As
    you begrudgingly prepare your supplies, you run into a friend of yours. They hear
    your frustration and offer to clean the stables for you, in return for a favour
    later down the line. What do you do?
  options:
  - 1. Thank them, but move and clean the stables on your own. You said you were going
    to clean the stables yourself, and not enjoying the task is not reason enough
    to shirk your duty. It is also never good to owe a favour.
  - 2. Accept the help and clean the stables together, deciding that two people will
    make the chore a breeze. A small favour in the future is a fair payment for a
    saved day.
  - 3. Take their offer, and enjoy your day to yourself. Your father asked for the
    stables to be cleaned, and clean they shall be. What does it matter who cleans
    them?
